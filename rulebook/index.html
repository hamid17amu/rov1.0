        <h2 id="objectives"><a class="header-link" href="#objectives"></a>Objectives</h2>
        <p><strong>AMUROV</strong> is a national-level student competition established to
            generate, cultivate, and enhance a community of innovators capable of
            making substantive contributions to the Remotely Operated
            Underwater Vehicles (ROVs) domain.
        </p>
        <p>Participants tackle fundamental challenges in the design of ocean
            systems capable of changing the world — while getting hands-on
            experience by designing, building and testing a remotely operated
            underwater vehicle. By providing a venue and mechanism to share
            knowledge and innovate, students are primed for jobs in developing,
            testing and managing state-of-the-art systems.

        <h3 id="Task1">Task 1 : Qualification Round</h3>
        <p>
            The primary objective of this qualification task is to evaluate the control of each team's vehicle. The task requires teams to navigate their Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) through a submerged gate. Teams must guide their ROV through the submerged gate without making contact with it. This task assesses the precision and stability of the vehicle's movement in a controlled aquatic environment. Each team will be given a specific time frame to complete the task, highlighting the efficiency and speed of their vehicle's navigation capabilities.

        <p class="image-caption"> Fig. 1.1 Top View </p>


        <h4 id="Task-specification1">Task Specification</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Time Limit: Each team has a maximum of 5 minutes to complete the task.</li>
            <li>Gate Dimensions: The gate is 1 meter wide, constructed entirely from PVC, and fully submerged underwater.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="points1">Points</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The total points to be awarded to a team for this task is 50.</li>
            <li>If the team completes the maneuvering round, it will be granted the whole of the 50 points.</li>
            <li>However, 5 points will be deducted every time the ROV touches the maze periphery.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="Props-Specification1">Props specification</h4>
        <p>
            The gate is made of Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) and is designed to remain submerged at a fixed depth within the pool. There are no additional obstacles or structures near the gate, providing a clear path for navigation.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Task2">Task 2 : Vision and Control</h3>
        <p>
            The goal of this nighttime challenge is to test the ROV's ability to use its vision system to locate and interact with specific targets in a dark pool environment. The task involves identifying and capturing a designated target amid two submerged balloons, each marked with a different color and flag. In the unlit pool, teams must utilize their ROV's onboard lights and vision capabilities to navigate to a target zone marked by two submerged balloons.
        </p>
        <p class="img-container"><img src="../images/rulebook/task2-tp.png" alt="flare"></p>
        <p class="image-caption"> Fig. 2.1 : Top View </p>
        <p>
            A target zone is established by two balloons with two different colors on each of the balloons, namely pink and orange, and two flags placed on the top section of the balloons. Fig. 2 depicts the position of the balloons in relation to the arena.
        </p>
        <p class="img-container"><img src="../images/rulebook/task2-fv.png" alt="flare"></p>
        <p class="image-caption"> Fig. 2.2 : Front View </p>
        <p>
            In the arena, there are two balloons. They're submerged in the target zone. On the top of both balloons,
            will be two flags. Each team is given a specific color representing a specific balloon. The ROV must begin
            at the starting position and then pass through the underwater gate, which is located around 5 m to 10 m from
            the starting point and has an inverted U form of height 1 m. When the ROV uses vision to locate the
            corresponding balloons with the specified color of blue and orange, points will be granted.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the ROV only wanders around the balloons with the prescribed color, it will receive some points; however, if the ROV touches the balloon with the respective/assigned color, it will receive additional points.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Task-specification2">Task Specification</h4>
        <p>
            This task is time bound and will be evaluated accordingly for a total of 15 minutes for each team.
        </p>

        <h4 id="points2">Points</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The total points to be awarded to a team for this task is 100.</li>
            <li>20 points will be given if the ROV passes through the gate.</li>
            <li>30 points will be given when touching the specific balloon.</li>
            <li>15 points will be given if the ROV wanders around the balloon with the prescribed color.</li>
            <li>If the team touches the wrong balloon, then ZERO points will be marked for the team instead of 35.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="Props-Specification2">Props specification</h4>
        <p>
            2 balloons with different colors will be tied to respective identical flags. The teams have to touch a specific balloon, whereas the other balloon should remain untouched. The pool is unlit, requiring the ROV to rely on its built-in lights and vision system.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Task3">Task 3 : The Maze Walk</h3>
        <p>
            The primary goal of this task is to assess the maneuverability and precision of the Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) as it navigates through a complex maze arena. The maze includes both surface-level paths and submerged sections, requiring the vehicle to demonstrate its capability to operate effectively in diverse aquatic conditions. Teams must guide their ROV along a marked path within the maze, starting from the designated entry point and moving toward the exit. The path is 100 cm wide and includes various obstacles and submerged gates, through which the vehicle must pass underwater. Precision and control are critical, as contact with the maze boundaries or obstacles will result in point deductions.
        </p>

        <h4 id="maze-structure">Maze Structure</h4>
        <p>The maze is divided into three distinct sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Section 1: Straight Path</strong></li>
            <p>This section features a clear path with no obstacles, allowing teams to focus on speed and control. It serves as an entry point to the maze, helping teams acclimate to the maze environment.</p>
            <li><strong>Section 2: Obstacle Course</strong></li>
            <p>Contains three strategically placed obstacles that the ROV must navigate around. Each successful navigation past an obstacle without contact earns points, while any contact results in a deduction of 5 points per obstacle.</p>
            <li><strong>Section 3: Submerged Passage</strong></li>
            <p>Features a covered section with walls up to 1 meter in height from the surface of the water. Teams must submerge their ROVs to pass through this area, demonstrating their vehicle's ability to navigate underwater.</p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>The total points to be awarded to a team for this task is 200.</li>
            <li>If the team completes the maneuvering round, it will be granted the whole of the 200 points.</li>
            <li>Completion of section 1 without any contact earns the full 50 points.</li>
            <li>30 points per successfully navigated obstacle (90 points total).</li>
            <li>An additional 10 points are awarded if all three obstacles are navigated without any contact.</li>
            <li>Completion of the submerged passage without contact with the walls earns the full 50 points.</li>
            <li>A deduction of 5 points will occur each time the ROV touches the maze periphery or any obstacle.</li>
